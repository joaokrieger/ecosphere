## Description
This project aims to create an educational game focused on teaching ecological concepts to elementary school students. The proposal involves applying educational methodologies and validating their impact on students' learning by comparing game interaction with traditional classroom instruction.

## Objectives

### Educational Objective
Teach ecological concepts to elementary school students in a fun and interactive way.

### Methodological Objective
Evaluate the effectiveness of the educational game compared to traditional teaching methods, using pre- and post-test questionnaires and the MEEGA+ model to evaluate educational games.

## Evaluation Protocol

All 6th grade elementary school students participated in the research, divided into two groups:

- **Control Group (GC)**: Composed of 17 students (n=17), this group started with a traditional class, followed by the application of Post-Test 1.

- **Experimental Group (GE)**: Composed of 15 students (n=15), this group began with interaction with the educational game, followed by the application of Post-Test 1.

## Results
The results were collected from the questionnaires applied:

- **Pre-Test**: Measured the students' initial knowledge.
- **Post-Test 1**: Evaluated knowledge progress after the first intervention (game or class).
- **Post-Test 2**: Evaluated knowledge after the second intervention (class or game).

## Hypothesis Validation
Statistical analysis of the collected data was performed using the PAST (Paleontological Statistics Software) tool. The software allowed the application of specific statistical tests to evaluate the following hypotheses:
- **Null Hypothesis 1 (H10)**: There is no statistically significant difference in the GE performance between the pre-test and Post-Test 1;
- **Alternative Hypothesis 1 (H11)**: There is a statistically significant difference in the GE performance between the pre-test and Post-Test 1;
- **Null Hypothesis 2 (H20)**: There is no statistically significant difference in the GC performance between the post-tests;
- **Alternative Hypothesis 2 (H21)**: There is a statistically significant difference in the GC performance between the post-tests;
- **Null Hypothesis 3 (H30)**: There is no statistically significant difference in the total performance between the groups;
- **Alternative Hypothesis 3 (H31)**: There is a statistically significant difference in the total performance between the groups;
- **Null Hypothesis 4 (H40)**: There is no statistically significant difference in the total performance of the students;
- **Alternative Hypothesis 4 (H41)**: There is a statistically significant difference in the total performance of the students.

The results obtained from the statistical analyses allowed the following conclusions about the game's effectiveness in the educational context:
- **Hypothesis H1 was rejected**, indicating that the game was effective in introducing the topic, contributing to the students' understanding;
- For **Hypothesis H2**, there is insufficient evidence to claim that the game was effective as a reinforcement of the content covered in the class, leading to the non-rejection of this hypothesis;
- For **Hypothesis H3**, it was found that the group that had the class before the game (GC) performed better than the GE, suggesting that prior content introduction favored the understanding of the topics explored in the game, which led to the rejection of Hypothesis H3;
- **Hypothesis H4 was rejected**, showing that lessons incorporating innovative methodologies, such as the use of games, can effectively improve students' performance in acquiring knowledge.
